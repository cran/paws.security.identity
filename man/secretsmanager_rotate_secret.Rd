\usage{
secretsmanager_rotate_secret(
  SecretId,
  ClientRequestToken = NULL,
  RotationLambdaARN = NULL,
  RotationRules = NULL,
  RotateImmediately = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{SecretId}{[required] The ARN or name of the secret to rotate.

For an ARN, we recommend that you specify a complete ARN rather than a
partial ARN. See \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/troubleshoot.html#ARN_secretnamehyphen}{Finding a secret from a partial ARN}.}

\item{ClientRequestToken}{A unique identifier for the new version of the secret. You only need to
specify this value if you implement your own retry logic and you want to
ensure that Secrets Manager doesn't attempt to create a secret version
twice.

If you use the Amazon Web Services CLI or one of the Amazon Web Services
SDKs to call this operation, then you can leave this parameter empty.
The CLI or SDK generates a random UUID for you and includes it as the
value for this parameter in the request.

If you generate a raw HTTP request to the Secrets Manager service
endpoint, then you must generate a \code{ClientRequestToken} and include it
in the request.

This value helps ensure idempotency. Secrets Manager uses this value to
prevent the accidental creation of duplicate versions if there are
failures and retries during a rotation. We recommend that you generate a
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier}{UUID-type}
value to ensure uniqueness of your versions within the specified secret.}

\item{RotationLambdaARN}{For secrets that use a Lambda rotation function to rotate, the ARN of
the Lambda rotation function.

For secrets that use \emph{managed rotation}, omit this field. For more
information, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/rotate-secrets_managed.html}{Managed rotation}
in the \emph{Secrets Manager User Guide}.}

\item{RotationRules}{A structure that defines the rotation configuration for this secret.}

\item{RotateImmediately}{Specifies whether to rotate the secret immediately or wait until the
next scheduled rotation window. The rotation schedule is defined in
RotateSecretRequest$RotationRules.

For secrets that use a Lambda rotation function to rotate, if you don't
immediately rotate the secret, Secrets Manager tests the rotation
configuration by running the \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/rotating-secrets.html#rotate-secrets_how}{\code{testSecret} step}
of the Lambda rotation function. The test creates an \code{AWSPENDING}
version of the secret and then removes it.

By default, Secrets Manager rotates the secret immediately.}

\description{
Configures and starts the asynchronous process of rotating the secret. For information about rotation, see \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/rotating-secrets.html}{Rotate secrets} in the \emph{Secrets Manager User Guide}. If you include the configuration parameters, the operation sets the values for the secret and then immediately starts a rotation. If you don't include the configuration parameters, the operation starts a rotation with the values already stored in the secret.
