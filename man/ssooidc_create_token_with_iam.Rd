applications that are authenticated using IAM entities}
\usage{
ssooidc_create_token_with_iam(
  clientId,
  grantType,
  code = NULL,
  refreshToken = NULL,
  assertion = NULL,
  scope = NULL,
  redirectUri = NULL,
  subjectToken = NULL,
  subjectTokenType = NULL,
  requestedTokenType = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{clientId}{[required] The unique identifier string for the client or application. This value
is an application ARN that has OAuth grants configured.}

\item{grantType}{[required] Supports the following OAuth grant types: Authorization Code, Refresh
Token, JWT Bearer, and Token Exchange. Specify one of the following
values, depending on the grant type that you want:
\itemize{
\item Authorization Code - \code{authorization_code}
\item Refresh Token - \code{refresh_token}
\item JWT Bearer - \code{urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:jwt-bearer}
\item Token Exchange - \code{urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:token-exchange}
}}

\item{code}{Used only when calling this API for the Authorization Code grant type.
This short-term code is used to identify this authorization request. The
code is obtained through a redirect from IAM Identity Center to a
redirect URI persisted in the Authorization Code GrantOptions for the
application.}

\item{refreshToken}{Used only when calling this API for the Refresh Token grant type. This
token is used to refresh short-term tokens, such as the access token,
that might expire.

For more information about the features and limitations of the current
IAM Identity Center OIDC implementation, see \emph{Considerations for Using
this Guide} in the \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/OIDCAPIReference/Welcome.html}{IAM Identity Center OIDC API Reference}.}

\item{assertion}{Used only when calling this API for the JWT Bearer grant type. This
value specifies the JSON Web Token (JWT) issued by a trusted token
issuer. To authorize a trusted token issuer, configure the JWT Bearer
GrantOptions for the application.}

\item{scope}{The list of scopes for which authorization is requested. The access
token that is issued is limited to the scopes that are granted. If the
value is not specified, IAM Identity Center authorizes all scopes
configured for the application, including the following default scopes:
\code{openid}, \code{aws}, \code{sts:identity_context}.}

\item{redirectUri}{Used only when calling this API for the Authorization Code grant type.
This value specifies the location of the client or application that has
registered to receive the authorization code.}

\item{subjectToken}{Used only when calling this API for the Token Exchange grant type. This
value specifies the subject of the exchange. The value of the subject
token must be an access token issued by IAM Identity Center to a
different client or application. The access token must have authorized
scopes that indicate the requested application as a target audience.}

\item{subjectTokenType}{Used only when calling this API for the Token Exchange grant type. This
value specifies the type of token that is passed as the subject of the
exchange. The following value is supported:
\itemize{
\item Access Token - \code{urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:access_token}
}}

\item{requestedTokenType}{Used only when calling this API for the Token Exchange grant type. This
value specifies the type of token that the requester can receive. The
following values are supported:
\itemize{
\item Access Token - \code{urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:access_token}
\item Refresh Token - \code{urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:refresh_token}
}}
}
\description{
Creates and returns access and refresh tokens for clients and applications that are authenticated using IAM entities. The access token can be used to fetch short-term credentials for the assigned AWS accounts or to access application APIs using \code{bearer} authentication.
