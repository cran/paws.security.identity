\usage{
securityhub_start_configuration_policy_disassociation(

)
}
\arguments{
\item{Target}{The identifier of the target account, organizational unit, or the root

\item{ConfigurationPolicyIdentifier}{[required] The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) or universally unique identifier (UUID)

\description{
Disassociates a target account, organizational unit, or the root from a specified configuration. When you disassociate a configuration from its target, the target inherits the configuration of the closest parent. If thereâ€™s no configuration to inherit, the target retains its settings but becomes a self-managed account. A target can be disassociated from a configuration policy or self-managed behavior. Only the Security Hub delegated administrator can invoke this operation from the home Region.
